I think deeply about the definition of L and K.
L can be interpreted in many ways.
Just  regard L as dependence on population and working hours or regard it as EFFL
K has many implications.
first, regard K as the flow of capital 
second , interpret K as the accumulation of capital
thirdly, interpret k as the sum of real capital and intangible assets
I use the variable in the PWT human capital in the ver 2 (EffL = hours × hc)
ver 1 is the code to calculate solow residual by the way i learn in the class
ver 2 is the code to calculate it by refering to Jorgenson & Griliches approach.
I use the variable in the PWT human capital in the ver 2 (EffL = hours × hc)
ver2 approach is different from ver 1 in regaring L as Hl(effective labor) and define HL as total hours * hc
that lead to lower TFP content
ver 3 is capital service model.
ver4 use PMI way to estimate K_t = (1 - δ)K_t-1 + I_t
this regard K as stock not as flow.This is natural because in the trajectory Of K_t is depending on investment and 
 not deprecation K_t-1 and this definition is often seen in Ramsey model.  
ver4 model result is normal and does not has too high or too low result
ver 5 regard K as the sum of real capital and R&D capital.
this lead to highest capital deepening rate and lowest TFP growth  and TFP share rate.
so in my opinion, ver 5 is not suitable to apprehend the substitute of graph 5.1
