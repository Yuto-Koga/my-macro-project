if you want to watch the result of  fixed alpha, watch simple version.

I think deeply about the definition of L and K.
L can be interpreted in many ways.
I have three L`s intepretations. L = [pop, emp * avh,emp * avh * hc ]

K has many implications.
I have three interpretatons. K = []
interpret K as the accumulation of capital
secondly, K_t  imply (1 - delta)K_t-1 + sy_t
thirdly, interpret k as the sum of real capital and intangible assets


ver 1 is the code to calculate solow residual by the way i learn in the class

ver 2 is the code to calculate it by refering to Jorgenson & Griliches approach.
I use the variable in the PWT human capital in the ver 2 (EffL = hours × hc)
ver2 approach is different from ver 1 in regaring L as Hl(effective labor) and define HL as total hours * hc
that lead to lower TFP content.These definition is often seen in advanced macro by Romer.

ver 3 is capital service model.I definde K_t as I_t + dep_t
This model is very diffent from the others models because this capture K as flow.
And unique result: capital share is very low because accumulation of K may be larger than flow of K.

ver4 use K_{t+1} = (1-δ_t)K_t + s * Y_t as a definition of K.(=Solow capital accumulation equation)
this regard K as stock not as flow.This is natural because  the trajectory Of K_t is depending on s:saving rate and 
deprecation K_t-1 and this definition can see the trajectory of K if you want.
ver4 model result may be odd in that TFP growth is so high.

ver 5 regard K as the sum of real capital and R&D capital.
this lead to highest capital deepening rate and lowest TFP growth  and TFP share rate.
so in my opinion, ver 5 is not suitable to apprehend the substitute of graph 5.1
