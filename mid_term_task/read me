I think deeply about the definition of L and K.
L can be interpreted in many ways.
Just think population, or regard L as dependence on population and working hours
K has many implications.
first, regard K as the flow of capital 
second , interpret K as the accumulation of capital
I use the variable in the PWT human capital in the ver 2 
second k` s definition depends on 
ver 1 is the code to calculate solow residual by the way i learn in the class
ver 2 is the code to calculate it by refering to Jorgenson & Griliches approach.
ver2 approach is different from ver 1 in regaring L as Hl(effective labor) and define HL as total hours * hc
that lead to lower TFP content
ver4 use PMI way to estimate K_t = (1 - Î´)K_t-1 + I_t
